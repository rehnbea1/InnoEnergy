Okay so this application works fine but is not compiling into an executable app properly.

In order to use the app, run the main function and download necessary packages, mainly pandas, tkinter, ttk, PIL and run the code in the terminal with python3 (used version 3.8.2 but should work with others also)

you should be able to get a window with the property of selecting files, then selecting optimization method, then the primary energies and then selection of lighting solution.

If there is any struggles, please do not hesitate to contact me on whatsapp, haha.
